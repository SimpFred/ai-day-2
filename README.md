# AI for Software Development Day 2 Exercise

## Learning Objectives

- Work with GitHub Copilot in VS Code
- Learn how to create React Projects to solve specific problems using Copilot
- Do the same for Angular Projects
- Investigate using Copilot with Java and .net Projects

### Afternoon Session

Copilot supports coding in both Java and C#.net, install the plugin for IntelliJ or Visual Studio depending on which language you have been learning. If you need them to, then your tutor will take you through the initial steps of how to use the plugin.

#### Things to Try

1. As you've done previously see how easy it is to use Copilot to create new, blank projects (both vanilla ones and backend ones).
2. How much manual intervention is required to get something workable, up and running?
3. Create new forks for some of your exercises and test out how easy it is to generate working solutions to them using Copilot.
4. Can you create a solution for the Cinema Booking Challenge?

Once you've spent a few hours playing with Copilot and your language of choice, investigate how easy it is to use Copilot with AWS or Azure to develop a cloud solution to some fo the tasks you looked at.

#### Links to Projects Solved using Copilot

- [Create React Project](https://github.com/SimpFred/ai-react-create-project)
  - Used this promt to generate whats in the repo: "I want to create a React project from scratch that can fetch data from localhost:4000/albums and display it in a nice way on localhost:4200."
- [Poker Challange](https://github.com/SimpFred/java-poker-challenge)
  - Solved the core and extension 1 & 2 for the poker challange by only using copilot.
- [Styled previous created React Project](https://github.com/SimpFred/ai-react-create-project/tree/styling-using-ai)
  - Styled the project by iterativ prompting to copilot.
